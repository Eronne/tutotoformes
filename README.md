Tutotoformes
======

A Symfony project created on August 18, 2016, 12:38 pm.

This symfony project was made during my 2nd year of my DUT MMI (Diplôme Universitaire Technologique en Métiers du Multimédia et de l'Internet).

The website is a MOOC platform, you can follow a course, you can create a course, you can edit courses, and you have achievements too!
It was a great project and thanks to this projet, I've learned a lot at how Symfony works (for exemple, I've created custom events, heavy usage of the Symfony Container etc...)

The website is available at [https://tutotoformes.herokuapp.com](https://tutotoformes.herokuapp.com)
